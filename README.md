# Resources for (ecological) researchers

If you are an researcher you need to write papers and sometimes give presentations about them. However, it's rare to get taught how to do the things we need to know in order to do these tasks- it's kinda expected that you will just make all this happen. In my experience, this approach doesn't work very well. Most theses and papers are frustratingly badly written, often with ugly figures, and academic talks are often pretty boring, even if the subject matter is actually fascinating.  

This is a curated collection of notes and resources to help researchers write papers, produce figures, and give better talks. I put this this collection together for student collaborators of mine who I thought might find it useful, but if you don't fit into that box and still find this useful, then great! I plan to constantly refine this collection so I'm also happy to take any suggestions for things I could add to the list or things you think I should modify. The collection is biased towards the kind of thing I work in, ecology and conservation, and I have no idea how well it transfers to other scientific disciplines. 

## Writing

Good scientific writing is concise, precise, and interesting.


The method that I like to use to structure and write papers follows that suggested on the [Conservation Bytes blog, which you can see here.](https://conservationbytes.com/2012/10/22/how-to-write-a-scientific-paper/) Below is a summary of the post which I have paraphrased.

### How to write a scientific article

#### Steps

1. **Brainstorm with your collaborators about your thoughts for the paper.** As the lead author you are the one responsible for deciding what goes into the paper and what doesn't.
2. **Write down the main message of the paper in 25 words or fewer.** ALthough you might have multiple results, there should only be one main message. If you have more than one message then you need to work harder to consense these or you have more than one paper that needs writing.
3. **Write a working abstract.** It should answer the following: (i) Why are you doing this? (ii) What did you do? (iii) What did you find? (iv) What does this mean? (v) What is it good for?
4. **Come up with a title** Based on the main message and working abstract write your title, or alternative versions of your title if you cannot decide. In most cases it is good to summarise the main result in your title - linking it direclty to the main message of the paper that you've already written.
5. **Decide on what display items should go into the paper.** Impose a strict limit of 6. If you have more than 6 items, rank them in order of importance and move the lowest ones to the online supplementary material.
6. **Create the figures and tables and write the legends for each**. Remember that each legend should allow a reader to interpret a figure/table without referring to the main text.
7. **Circulate the choice of display items with legends to your coauthors.** Revise accordingly until everyone is happy with the selection and presentation.
8. **Plan the skeleton of the paper.** ***This requires lots of thinking and can take a long time*** - up to a day or more depending on what exactly you are doing.
    1. **Decide on the length of the main text.** This will vary a lot depending on exactly where you are thinking of submitting the paper, but I recommend aiming for around 3000-4000 words of text. If you need to write more it can go in the supplementary materials.
    2. **Work out the relative size of each section** (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion). A rule of thumb split for a 3000 word article is 600, 900, 500, 800, 200, but it varies depending on how much context setting is required, how many lines of evidence you are using, etc. Yet, despite this, it surprisingly often works out at roughly this ratio.
    3. **For each section, plan the paragraphs.** Each paragraph should be 100 to 250 words long, but at the moment all you need to do is write out the main message of each paragraph in 15 words or fewer. Each paragraph should only be about one main thing. Now play around with the order of the paragraphs until you are happy with the logical flow of the text.
    4. **Add notes to each paragraph** These can include keywoods, references that you want to cite, figures to refer to etc.
    5. **Circulate your plan** Send the skeleton plan of the paper to you co-authors and invite feedback. Indicate that you want critical feedback of the structure now, in order to fix any problems early on.
9. **Write the paragraphs.** Because of the structure and flow of the paper is already established you can now write the paragraphs in whatever order you want. This really helps because some sections area easier (for me the methods and results) than others (the discussion) and so allows you to get some text down - helping with writers block. 
10. **Revise the working abstract** Convert the abstract into a final draft form based on how the paper has changed suring the writing phase.
11. **Circulare the draft** Circulate the draft manuscript to co-authors and give them enough time (2 weeks?) for feedback.

#### Modifications for student disserations

The method above applies pretty well to writing student undergraduate and masters dissertations, but a few tweaks are needed. For PhD theses, you should think of each chapter as a paper, so in this case it's safe to follow the above guidance to the letter.

The biggest difference between a dissertation and a paper is the length. Dissertations are generally allowed to be longer than the average published paper and in some cases this is a requirement. So when you set yourself a limit for the lengh of the piece of work (point 8) modify this based on the guidance that your institution gives you. The same goes for the number of display items (point 6) - you may want to include more than 6 display items. This is fine.

# Giving presentations

Most scientific presentations are **not good**. Most of them don't even approach good. I'm not even sure that most scientists even know what a good talk looks like. Although I don't think I can make all talks good, I can definately provide people with a recipe to make their talks better. The three key points of this recipe is are:

1. Plan what you want to say before you do anything else
2. Turn this plan into simple, uncluttered, and attractive slides
3. Practice the hell out of your talk

If you want a more detailed version of this, see below.

## Plan what you want to say

It seems obvious that you would plan what you want to say before you start putting together your slides for a presentation. However, in my experience, people start with the slides and then work out what they want to say. This wastes time because you foten have to rework your slides and also risks you not getting your message accross to your audience.

When planning your talk one key thing to remember is that your talk should not be your paper/thesis read out loud with accompanying figures. It is it's own thing. Text as written in a paper would sound a bit strange coming out of a person's mouth. We should also think the same way about all the elements of a talk (e.g. the figures/tables etc).

When planning your talk, the following structure can be helpful

1. **Identify your audience** What are they interested in? What is their previous knowledge on the topic you will talk about?
2. **Identify the key message of your talk** What is the overarching thing that you want people to take away from your talk? Write it down in 25 words or less. 
3. **Brainstorm the talk** - Identify the key content you want to include to support the key message of your talk and its broad structure. For a talk at a scientific conference, don't just stick to the traditional structure that you find in papers. This is incredibly boring. Think creatively about the structure. Ideally the structure should mirror that of a story with a narrative arc. Often, in science (particularly in ecology and conservation) this will be something akin to a quest of some sort, where we identify something important (e.g. forests), a threat to them (e.g. deforestation), and then talk about our quest to solve an aspect of this problem.
4. **Think about how to hook your audience** You only get a short time to grab the attention of any audience before they start to switch off, so come out swinging. Think of where the interests of your audience and your main message overlap and work on coming up with something that will get them engaged from the beginning. Things that can work particuarly well are starting with a question, starting with an eye-opening statistic, or jumping straight into a topic with no intro (aka a [cold open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_open)). Be creative and think about what will get people engaged. Think about how to transition between your hook and your main message.
5. **Plan the content of the talk** Create a draft outline of the talk with a sentance (~15 words) for each major point you want to get across in the presentation. Rework the ordering of this until you are happy with the structure.
6. **Write the talk** Personally, I write out almost exactly what I want to say for a presentation and learn this. This doesn't work for everyone, but it's helpful to have a reasonably detailed plan of what you want to say.
7. **Design your slides** Now you can start to design your slides. It may be useful to sketch out roughly what you want slides to look like before you start to put them together in powerpoint or whatever you use. I could write a whole guide on how to design good slides, but here are some good general rules to follow:
    1. **Don't use lots of text on a slide** A slide is a visual aid, it is not your presentation. You should only read the text from your slides sparingly. Most slides should have little to no text, apart from summary slides.
    2. **Use large fonts** I've been to too many talks where people say "Sorry if you can't see this at the back of the room." Design your slides for the person at the back of the room. This means that all text should generally have a point size of at least 30. This also goes for figures. If you are going to use figures from a paper/dissertation you are working on, redraw them for the presentation with bigger text and larger symbols.
    3. **Use sans serif fonts** The best fonts to use for a presentation are ones that are easy to read. This usually means using simple, clean sans serif fonts. Good fonts for presentations available in Powerpoint include Futura, Verdana, Tahoma, and Gill Sans.
    4. **Use good images** There are lots of resources for free images available online (such as those listed [here](https://twitter.com/rodriguesjm6/status/1476580189316562953)), so use them. Make sure to get high resolution images so that they look crisp on a big screen.
    5. **One idea per slide** Don't be tempted to cram more than one idea onto a slide. If you have more than one figure that you want to put into a section of the talk, use seperate slides. Similarly, if you want to make more than one point using an image or text (apart from maybe a summary slide at the end) it's best to do this using more than one slide.
    6. **Be consistent** Use the same fonts and colours thoughout your slides, otherwise your talk will look less professional and jumbled.
    7. **Avoid animations** Animations generally make your presentation look a bit cheap and distract people from your actual message. Therefore it´s best to avoid animations. The only ones that are worth using are the ones that animate bullet points where you want to talk about one topic at a time (e.g. on a summary slide) or the ones that allow you to change the emphasis of text (e.g. by changing the colour of certain bits of text).
8. **Practice, practice, practice (and edit your talk)** In order to give a good talk, you need to practice it. Practice until you are comfortable saying what you want without looking at a script. One way to get a good idea of how your talk comes across is to film yourself giving it. It is uncomfortable to watch yourself but it can be incredibly useful for working out what comes across well. Practicing your talk out-loud also makes it clear which parts of your talk work and which don't, so following practice sessions it can be useful to edit the content.
