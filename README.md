# Resources for (ecological) researchers

If you are an researcher you need to write papers and sometimes give presentations about them. However, it's rare to get taught how to do the things we need to know in order to do these tasks- it's kinda expected that you will just make all this happen. In my experience, this approach doesn't work very well. Most theses and papers are frustratingly badly written, often with ugly figures, and academic talks are often pretty boring, even if the subject matter is actually fascinating.  

This is a curated collection of notes and resources to help researchers write papers, produce figures, and give better talks. I put this this collection together for student collaborators of mine who I thought might find it useful, but if you don't fit into that box and still find this useful, then great! I plan to constantly refine this collection so I'm also happy to take any suggestions for things I could add to the list or things you think I should modify. The collection is biased towards the kind of thing I work in, ecology and conservation, and I have no idea how well it transfers to other scientific disciplines.
