# Resources for (ecological) researchers

If you are an ecological researcher you need to write papers and sometimes give presentations about them. However, it's very to get taught how to do the things we need to do these tasks- it's kinda expected that you will just make this, well, happen. In my experience, this approach doesn't work very well. Most theses and papers are frustratingly badly written, often with ugly figures, and academic talks are often pretty boring, even if the subject matter is actually fascinating.  

This is a curated list of resources to help researchers produce figures, write papers, and give better talks. I initially intended this as something that collaborators of mine might find useful, but if you don't fit into that box and still find this useful, then great! I'm also happy to take any suggestions for things I could add to the list.

# Writing

Good scientific writing is concise, precise, and interesting.

# Giving presentations

Must follow rules for slide design:

* Don't read out text from slides
* Use a large font
* Use emphasis
* Use good images
* Use white space
* Be consistent
* Skip animations
* Create the slides last
